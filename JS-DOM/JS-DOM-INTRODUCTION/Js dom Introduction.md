# THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL (DOM)

As you already know, the backbone of an HTML document is elements.

When an HTML document is loaded, the browser creates an *HTML Document Object Model* or *HTML DOM*.

# WHAT IS THE DOM?
The *DOM* is created by the browser when an HTML document is loaded.

It is a *tree structure* representation of an HTML structure.

The *DOM tree* contains all the elements in a document.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title></title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1> A Header </h1>
    <p> A Paragraph <p>
</body>
</html>

Note! in a DOM tree, all element are *objects*
