# WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT?

Javascript is a programming language or a scripting language that allows the implementation of features on web pages.

* HERE IS AN EXPLANATION!
To better understand Javascript, we can look back at what we already know.

We know that HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE(HTML) elements are the building blocks of web pages.

And CASCADING STYLE SHEET (CSS) is used for designing HTML elements.

Javascript on the other hand, is what implements the features of web pages.

We can simplify this explanation by taking a look at the example in the Introduction.html file.
