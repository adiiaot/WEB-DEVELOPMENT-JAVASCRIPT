# JAVASCRIPT RESERVED KEYWORDS
JavaScript reserved keywords can NOT be used as identifiers.

That means you cannot use reserved keywords sa variables or function names.

This example will not work as expected because it uses a reserved keyword (catch) as a variable anem.

<script>
    const catch = "ball";
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = catch;
</script>

HEAD OVER TO catch.html
