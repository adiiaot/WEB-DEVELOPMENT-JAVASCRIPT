# JAVASCRIPT DISPLAYING OUTPUTS

Displaying or generating outputs in JavaScript is very important especially when learning the language.

For example, if you want to view if your JS statements or code blocks are correct, you can output data to check.

* THERE ARE 4 WAYS TO DISPLAY OUTPUT IN JAVASCRIPT

1. # USING THE CONSOLE
By using the "console.log()" function, we can write into the browser's developer console.

HEAD OVER TO THE "console.js" FILE


(THE console.log() cannot be seen on mobile devices because the developer console is only available on desktop browsers like chrome and Firefox)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

2. # USING DIALOG BOXED
By using the "alert()" function, we can output data on a dialog box.

HEAD OVER TO THE "dialog.html" FILE.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

3. # WRITING TO HTML ELEMENTS
By using the "innerHTML" property, we can change the content or text fo the selected element.

We can use the "document.getElementById()" function to select an element.

HEAD OVER TO "writingtohtml.html" FILE.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

4. # WRITING TO BROWSER WINDOW
By using the "document.write()" function, we can write to the content of the document.

*THIS SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR TESTING PURPOSES AS IT WILL DELETE ALL EXISTING HTML IN THE CURRENT PAGE*

HEAD OVER TO "browserwindow.html
